      For millions of people, a cat is a favorite pet. But among these millions
      there are people who suffer from fur allergies. In this case, the best
      solution would be to get a sphynx - this is a hairless cat that will not
      only protect your health, but also create a minimum of trouble when
      cleaning the apartment. In this case, allergies will not become an
      obstacle to communication with your beloved pet. But at the same time, you
      should remember that caring for sphinxes requires a serious and
      responsible approach: hairless cats are very sensitive to temperature
      changes. Low temperature is especially dangerous for them. Therefore, if
      you decide to take care of a sphynx kitten or an adult cat, learn
      everything about the character and characteristics of these cats.

      baby shampoo is the best bath product in the absence of a special bath
      product
    </li>

      do not rub cream or oil into the sphynx's skin after bathing, this harms
      the condition of the skin
    </li>
    <li>
      after bathing, wrap the cat in a towel and gently wet it, not wipe the
      skin
